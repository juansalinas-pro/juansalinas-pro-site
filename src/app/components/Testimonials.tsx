    content: 'Juan was the leader of my team in one of my first work experiences, and to this day, he serves as an example of a good programmer and professional. He is very serious and responsible, committed to the team, and an expert in Java. He had a lot of patience when I knew almost nothing and taught me to seek to understand each problem, break it down into parts, and justify the possible solutions. At every stage of the project, he encouraged us to maintain good practices and documentation, and he motivated the entire team to keep studying and become independent, which I consider the most important characteristic of a leader.',
